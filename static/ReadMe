Cure Connect is an interface between a prescriber/ doctor and a patient dealing with long-term diseases like diabetes, high blood pressure, etc. It is an additional tool that aids doctors keep a track of medicines and reactions their patients have. The database consists of common symptoms to medications and lists them for the three kinds of medicines considered in the project- insulin, clonidine and lisinopril. Additionally it includes unusual symptoms that require a medical professional’s immediate attention. The website consists of two parts:
Doctor’s portal: This includes data of all the patients with their medical information and a ‘score’ of their health. They are listed in a decreasing sequence of severity of their disease.
Patients’ portal: Patients can take check-in tests on their portal. The questions are about the patient’s reaction to medication. A normal reaction is desired. In case of unusual reactions, the model calculates a higher score and places the patient’s profile higher and notifies the doctor.
The purpose of this project is to reduce fatalities and inconveniences caused due to unsuitable and wrong medication, or Adverse Drug Reaction(ADR). If a patient facing severe symptoms is unable to analyse his situation, the model speeds up the process of getting an immediate checkup to avoid a serious fatality.
